# Database

Part of Scenario Week 5. The aim is to design vulnerable/secure websites, and hack into the vulernable one to demonstrate security issues.

This is the repo for the database. On the master branch a blank sw5.sql file can be found that is a template for the data used. On the branch "test", the sw5.sql file contains data that assists in testing and simulating use of the application.

The code for the vulnerable site can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Website

The code for the secure site can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Website-Stable

And finally the any code used for pentesting can be found here: https://github.com/ucl-no0bs/Website-Stable
